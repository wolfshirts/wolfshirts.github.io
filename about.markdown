Hi, I'm a security engineer. I enjoy working on defense and writing custom tooling to protect platforms and services, I also enjoy hacking on VM's from vulnhub. I think the somewhat adversarial nature of security makes it an interesting space to work in.

In my free time I like to play music, hike, and camp.
