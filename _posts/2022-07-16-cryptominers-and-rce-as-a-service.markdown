I just spent a year fighting cryptomining at a CI/CD company. It was definitely an exciting opportunity and I enjoyed the
time I spent there. I also learned a lot about cryptomining on CI/CD and other RCE as a service type platforms. Some
of it is fairly obvious and other parts aren't.

## Background
Cryptocurrency is big, and it seems to be even bigger in developing nations. Mining for cryptocurrency can be expensive,
not everyone wants to front the cost themselves. Sometimes the cost is more than the currency is worth. Luckily for
cryptominers there's plenty of platforms that offer RCE (remote code execution) as a service, often with a free tier.
